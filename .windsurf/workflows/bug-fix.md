### Purpose
Investigate and fix a bug based on observed symptoms. Ensure consistent diagnostics using Context7, root cause analysis, and safe handling of any database operations using US RPC and supabase MCP for migrations.


### Symptoms



### Workflow
1. Use `Context7` to find related files, MCPs, and task history.
2. Trace execution path of affected code.
3. Identify probable root cause.
4. Suggest minimal reproducible example or test case.
5. Use `US RPC` functions for DB ops. Apply migrations via `supabase` MCP if needed.
6. Propose and implement fix.
7. Verify with logs and expected behavior.
8. Mark related Taskmaster task as resolved if applicable.
