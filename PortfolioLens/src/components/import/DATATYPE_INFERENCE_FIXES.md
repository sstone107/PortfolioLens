# Data Type Inference Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This document describes the improvements made to the `dataTypeInference.ts` module to fix issues with incorrectly classifying numeric fields as dates, particularly in the context of mortgage loan data.

## Key Improvements

1. **More Conservative Date Detection**:
   - Modified `isLikelyDate()` to automatically reject single and double-digit values (0-99)
   - Required date format separators (/, -, .) for positive detection
   - Enhanced validation for numeric values that might be misinterpreted as dates

2. **Better Field Name Pattern Analysis**:
   - Added dedicated `analyzeFieldNamePattern()` function with regex patterns for different data types
   - Prioritized integer detection for fields with names containing words like "number", "count", "units", etc.
   - Implemented pattern detection for DPD (Days Past Due) fields common in mortgage data
   - Reduced confidence of date detection from field names to prevent overriding actual data evidence

3. **Value Distribution Pattern Analysis**:
   - Added `detectValuePatterns()` to identify patterns in data like:
     - Single-digit values (0-9)
     - Double-digit values (0-99)
     - Day range values (1-31)
     - Small integers (0-999)
   - Used pattern detection to override date classification for fields that exhibit integer patterns

4. **Priority Hierarchy Restructuring**:
   - Reordered the type detection hierarchy to check for integer patterns before dates
   - Added early-exit conditions for common integer patterns to prevent misclassification
   - Increased confidence for integer detection from field name + sample pattern matches
   - Added special handling for mortgage industry fields like loan terms, age, etc.

5. **Enhanced Conflict Resolution**:
   - Added specific handling for conflicts between date detection and integer evidence
   - Implemented a pattern-based approach rather than hardcoding specific field names
   - Added logging of conflicting indicators for better transparency

## Examples of Fixed Issues

The following field types are now correctly classified:

1. **Single-digit fields**: Values like "1", "2", "3" in fields like "Number of Units" or "Payment Day"
2. **Zero-value fields**: Values like "0" in "Days Past Due" or "DPD Count" fields
3. **Small integer fields**: Values in range 0-99 for fields with names suggesting counts or quantities
4. **Loan-specific fields**: "Loan Age", "Amortization Term", etc. with numeric values

## Testing

A test suite was developed to verify the fixes, covering all the problematic field examples as well as validating that legitimate date, timestamp, boolean, and numeric fields are still correctly identified.

All tests are now passing, showing that the implementation successfully addresses the integer vs. date confusion issues while maintaining correct type detection for all other data types.
