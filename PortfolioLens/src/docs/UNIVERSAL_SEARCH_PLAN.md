# Universal Loan Search: Implementation Subtasks

## Parent Task: Universal Loan Search
**Description**: Build a simple, powerful search box that searches across multiple loan parameters with a single input

**Details**: Implement a universal search functionality that allows users to quickly find loans by typing in a single search box. The search should look across common parameters like borrower names (first and last), loan numbers, investor loan numbers, emails, phone numbers, property addresses, and other identifiers. Results should display as suggestions while typing and allow quick navigation to the detailed loan view. This feature complements the existing advanced search by providing a faster, more intuitive way to find specific loans.

## Subtasks Breakdown

### Subtask 1: Design Universal Search UI Components

## Dependencies
- Advanced Loan Search (Task 9.1) - Completed
- Detailed Loan Information View (Task 9.2) - In progress

## Estimated Effort
- Frontend Components: 3-4 days
- Backend API: 2-3 days
- Database Optimization: 1-2 days
- Integration: 2 days
- Testing: 2-3 days
- Documentation: 1 day

Total: Approximately 2-3 weeks depending on team capacity

## Priority
High - This feature will significantly improve user experience for loan searching and complement the advanced search functionality.

## Notes
